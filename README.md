## :computer: Installation
You need to have [Max/MSP](https://cycling74.com/downloads). If you use the Max4Live (M4L) version, make sure your computer has Max 4 Live by following [M4L Setup](https://help.ableton.com/hc/en-us/categories/201105669-Max-for-Live).

Follow the link [M4L](https://github.com/naliMusic/SimpleSynth/blob/main/SimpleSynth.amxd) or [MAXpatch](https://github.com/naliMusic/SimpleSynth/blob/main/SimpleSynth_MAX.maxpat):

```
1. Choose 'view raw' to download the SimpleSynth.amxd or SimplerSynth_MAX.maxpat device
2. Copy the device into your dedicated Max4Live/MaxMSP folder
3. For M4L version, in Ableton Live, drag the .amxd device into a track to use
```
